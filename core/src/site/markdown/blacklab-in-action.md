# See BlackLab in action


For a quick example of a BlackLab application, have a look at either of these:

- [Brieven als Buit](https://brievenalsbuit.ivdnt.org/) ("Letters as Loot"), where you can search a collection of historical letters to and from sailors from the 17th to the 19th century
- [Corpus Gysseling](https://corpusgysseling.ivdnt.org/), a small corpus of historic Dutch (1200-1300)

If you have a [CLARIN](https://clarin.eu/) account, you might also want to check out:

- [Corpus Hedendaags Nederlands](https://chn.ivdnt.org/)
- [OpenSonar](https://opensonar.ivdnt.org/)

Here are a few searches you can try:

- **Lemma: "koe"** Finds all forms of the word "koe" (cow)<br/>
  Other words to try: "wet" (law), "zien" (to see), "groot" (large)
- **POS: "NOU\*"** Find all nouns<br/>
  Other values to try: "VRB\*" (verbs), "ADJ\*" (adjectives)
- **Word form: "coe"** Find a specific historic spelling of "koe"

Please note that this is just a small sample of the capabilities of BlackLab.
