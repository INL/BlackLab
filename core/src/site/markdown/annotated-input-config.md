# Annotated input format configuration file

NOTE: this is about the new way of indexing, using index format configuration files, available starting from BlackLab 1.7.0. The older, more direct way of indexing is still supported (although parts may be removed or changed in future versions); see [here](indexing-with-blacklab.html). 

For more task-oriented documentation, see [How to configure indexing](how-to-configure-indexing.html).
