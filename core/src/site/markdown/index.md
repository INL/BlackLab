# Introduction

## What is BlackLab?

BlackLab is an open source corpus search engine built on top of [Apache Lucene](http://lucene.apache.org/). It allows fast, complex searches with accurate hit highlighting on large, tagged and annotated, bodies of text.

## Who is it for?

BlackLab was designed primarily for linguists who want to search for (potentially complex) patterns in large bodies of text annotated with linguistic properties (headword, part-of-speech, paragraphs, sentences, named entities, etc.). Apart from that, BlackLab is also being used for other purposes, including historical research and artifical intelligence.

## How do I use it?

If you want to use BlackLab in your own projects, it's available both as a web service (BlackLab Server) and a Java library (BlackLab Core). It's easy to use BlackLab from your favourite programming language.

## Who made BlackLab?

BlackLab was developed at the [Dutch Language Institute (INT)](http://www.ivdnt.org/) to provide a fast and feature-rich search interface on our historical and contemporary text corpora. It was released as open source (Apache License 2.0) in 2012 and has since gathered a number of users and contributors. It is still in active development.
