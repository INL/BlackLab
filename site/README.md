# BlackLab end-user documentation site

This Vuepress site will in time replace the current Maven-generated site.
It's still being restructured and expanded and there may be broken links.
Work in progress.

To install dependencies:

    npm install

To run in development mode:

    npm run dev

To build production site (written to docs/.vuepress/dist):

    npm run build
