# Using BlackLab Server

::: warning Work in progress
This will become a guided introduction to BlackLab Server. See the [REST API reference](rest-api/) for details about each endpoint.

## Overview

### JSON, XML or CSV?

The webservice answers in JSON or XML. Selection of the desired output format can be done two ways:

- by passing the HTTP header `Accept` with the value `application/json`, `application/xml` or `text/csv`
- by passing an extra parameter `outputformat` with the value `json`, `xml` or `csv`

If both are specified, the parameter has precedence.

We'll usually use JSON in our examples.

::: info Extra parameters for CSV

(for CSV hits/docs results, the parameters `csvsummary` determines whether to include a summary of 
the search parameters in the output `[no]` and `csvsepline` determines whether to include a separator declaration 
that will help Microsoft Excel read the file `[no]`)

### Running results count

BlackLab Server is mostly stateless: a particular URL will always result in the same response. An exception to this is the running result count. When you're requesting a page of results, and there are more results to the query, BlackLab Server will retrieve these results in the background. It will report how many results it has retrieved and whether it has finished or is still retrieving.

A note about retrieving versus counting. BLS has two limits for processing results: maximum number of hits to retrieve/process and maximum number of hits to count. Retrieving or processing hits means the hit is stored and will appear on the results page, is sorted, grouped, faceted, etc. If the retrieval limit is reached, BLS will still keep counting hits but will no longer store them.


## Examples

There's code examples of using BlackLab Server from [a number of different programming languages](from-different-languages.md).

Below are examples of individual requests to BlackLab Server.
