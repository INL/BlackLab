## Who made it?

BlackLab was developed at the [Dutch Language Institute (INT)](http://www.ivdnt.org/) to provide a fast and feature-rich search interface on our historical and contemporary text corpora. It was released as open source (Apache License 2.0) in 2012 and has since gathered a number of users and contributors. It is still in active development.
