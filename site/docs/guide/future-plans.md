# Future plans

Broadly speaking, these are our plans for the future:

- Improve performance and memory requirements (ongoing)
- Keep up with new Lucene versions (ongoing)
- Scale to larger corpora by adding support for distributed search,
  through integration with Solr (2022)
- Make the content store optional, and make it easier for applications 
  to provide their own way of accessing the original content (for hits 
  highlighting). (2022)
- Add support for tree-like structures to enable e.g. treebanks-like searches.
- Add support for parallel corpora
- Integrate improvements and suggestions from the community ([issues](https://github.com/INL/BlackLab/issues) and [pull requests](https://github.com/INL/BlackLab/pulls) welcome!)

For more (somewhat technical) details, see the corresponding [BARKs](https://github.com/INL/BlackLab/tree/dev/doc/bark#readme) (short descriptions of planned development and other information).
