# Who is using BlackLab?

A number of institutes and companies have chosen BlackLab for their corpus or text analysis projects.

If you're using BlackLab, [let us know](/guide/about.md#contact-us); we'd like to mention your project here!

- The Dutch Language Institute ([INT](https://www.ivdnt.org/)) is leading BlackLab development and uses it for their corpora, such as its internal Corpus of Contemporary Dutch (\~2.2 billion tokens and growing), [Letters as loot](https://brievenalsbuit.ivdnt.org/corpus-frontend/BaB/search/), [Corpus Gysseling](https://corpusgysseling.ivdnt.org/corpus-frontend/Gysseling/search/) and the [Corpus Hedendaags Nederlands](http://chn.ivdnt.org/), a 1+ billion token public Corpus of Contemporary Dutch.
- [Lexion AI](https://www.lexion.ai/), who develop a contract management system. Lexion has an interestingly different use case from INT, with high query volume on many smaller indexes. We are grateful for their valuable contributions to the project.
- [In Search of the Drowned](https://lts.fortunoff.library.yale.edu/): Testimonies and Testimonial Fragments of the Holocaust, edited and built by Gabor M. Toth in collaboration with the Yale Digital Humanities Laboratory.
- [OpenSonar](http://opensonar.ivdnt.org), a Dutch corpus, by the University of Tilburg in collaboration with the Dutch Language Institute. The look and feel of [our corpus frontend](https://github.com/INL/corpus-frontend) was developed as part of this collaboration as well, for which we'd like to thank Martin Reynaert and Matje van de Camp.
- [Cosycat](https://github.com/emanjavacas/cosycat/), corpus query and annotation interface used for the [Mind-Bending Grammars project](https://www.uantwerpen.be/en/projects/mind-bending-grammars/), University of Antwerp.
- [IKE](https://github.com/allenai/ike), a knowledge extraction tool, developed at the Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence. Allen AI has made very useful contributions as well, improving performance and fixing bugs.
- [VIVA Korpusportaal](https://viva-afrikaans.org/portale/produkte-korpus/access-to-korpusportaal), Virtuele Instituut Vir Afrikaans (South Africa)
- [SADiLaR corpus portal](https://corpus.sadilar.org/corpusportal/search/simple), South African Centre for Digital Language Resources
- [EarlyPrint](https://earlyprint.org/how-to/intro_to_lingustic_search.html), early English print record, by Martin Mueller and Philip Burns at Northwestern University.
- [Arabic Digital Humanities](http://arabic-dh.hum.uu.nl/corpus-frontend/about). The right-to-left
  support in our corpus frontend came about thanks to this project.
- [Fryske Akademy](https://www.fryske-akademy.nl/), NL (restricted corpus). Eduard Drenth has made some valuable contributions as well, such as the option to use the Saxon parser.
- [cosycat](https://github.com/emanjavacas/cosycat) (Collaborative Synchronized Corpus Annotation Tool)
- [Latin lemmatized texts](https://blacklab.alpheios.net/latin-texts/search) ([Alpheios](https://alpheios.net/))
- [Corpus of Spoken Hindi](http://www.cosh.site/) (Japan)
