# BARK 10 - Searching tree-like structures

- **type:** change
- **status:** planned (2023)

We want to enable additional search operations on tree-like structures.

## Why?

We want to be able to search dependency and syntax trees.
This task is part of the CLARIAH-NL project.

## How?

Open question. Full treebank functionality at speeds competitive with dedicated solutions is probably not in the cards for BlackLab, but with some clever indexing, partial support with reasonable performance should be possible.

Some new search primitives will be required, such as querying by relationship, and some existing features may need to be improved, such as the containing/within operators.

## When?

before 2024

## Impact on users

None. This is an optional feature.
