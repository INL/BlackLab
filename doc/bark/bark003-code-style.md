# BARK 3 - Code style

- **type:** information
- **status:** active

For contributors: please use your IDEs built-in code formatter to adhere to BlackLab's coding style. It is mostly standard Java style.

Configurations for IDE code formatters can be found in the [../../build-tools/](../../build-tools/) directory:
- **IntelliJ IDEA:** [formatter-intellij.xml](../../build-tools/formatter-intellij.xml) 
- **Eclipse:** [formatter-eclipse.xml](../../build-tools/formatter-eclipse.xml)

An [EditorConfig](https://editorconfig.org/) file is included as well and may be picked up by your IDE or editor automatically.
