# BlackLab Archives of Relevant Knowledge (BARKs)

This is intended to be a collection of short documents about the development of BlackLab.

They describe processes and plans for BlackLab. These are intended to be like RFCs or Python's PEPs, but even less formal.

Types of BARKs:

- **Information**, some information about BlackLab, e.g. a bit of history.
- **Process**, about how we develop BlackLab, for example a backwards compatibility policy.
- **Change**, about a new feature or implementation in BlackLab, for example better support for searching tree-like structures.

See below for the current list. Each BARK can be extended and improved over time. Previous versions are recorded in version control.

Changes also have a status: planned, in development, experimental or production.
