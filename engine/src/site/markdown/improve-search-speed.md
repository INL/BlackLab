# Improving Search Speed

At the Dutch Language Institute, we use a tool called [vmtouch](http://hoytech.com/vmtouch/) written by Doug Hoyte to 'lock' our forward indices in the operating system's disk cache, keeping them in memory at all times. This speeds up sorting and grouping operations, as well as generating (large amounts of) KWICs (keyword-in-context results).

vmtouch is a tool that can "lock" a file in disk cache. It benefits applications that need to perform fast random access to large files (i.e. several gigabytes). Corpus search applications fall into this domain: they need random access to the "forward index" component of the index to do fast sorting and grouping.

You should be careful to ensure the machine you're using has enough RAM to keep the required files in memory permanently, and will still have memory left over for the operating system and applications.

Also important is to run vmtouch as the root user; user accounts have a limit to the amount of memory they may lock. Vmtouch will terminate with an out of memory error if it hits that limit. (it may be possible to raise this limit for a user by changing a configuration file - we haven't experimented with this)

The [official page for vmtouch](http://hoytech.com/vmtouch/) has the C source code and the online manual. We've made a slight modification to the source code to allow for larger files to be cached. The full source code of the version we're using is included in the vmtouch/ directory of the BlackLab source distribution.

## Building vmtouch

The BlackLab source distribution includes a vmtouch/ directory with the source code for vmtouch, modified to increase the limit to 6 GB per file.

**NOTE**: [Doug Hoyte](http://hoytech.com/vmtouch/) wrote and holds the copyright for the vmtouch code. He has released it under a permissive license (see vmtouch.c for the complete license text).

To build it using gcc and GNU Make, just type:

	make

### Filesize limit

The original vmtouch has a built-in 500 MB per file limit (probably as a safety precaution). We needed to raise this limit to allow for our 2GB+ files. Hence this line:

	size_t o_max_file_size=500*1024*1024;

was changed to:

	size_t o_max_file_size=6L*1024*1024*1024;

(Please note that if you wish to cache files larger than 6 GB, you will need to change this line again)

## Running vmtouch

To run vmtouch in daemon mode, so that it will lock files in the disk cache, use the following command line:

	sudo vmtouch -vtld <list_of_files>

The switches: v=verbose, t=touch (load into disk cache), l=lock (lock in disk cache), d=daemon (keep the program running). For example, we use the following command line to keep all four forward indices of our BlackLab index locked in disk cache (run from within the index directory):

	sudo vmtouch -vtld fi_contents%word/tokens.dat fi_contents%lemma/tokens.dat fi_contents%pos/tokens.dat fi_contents%punct/tokens.dat

The daemon will start up and will take a while to load all files into disk cache. You can check its progress by only specifying the -v option:

	sudo vmtouch -v fi_contents%word/tokens.dat fi_contents%lemma/tokens.dat fi_contents%pos/tokens.dat fi_contents%punct/tokens.dat

## Helper scripts

We have written a few simple helper scripts for using vmtouch. These scripts are included in the vmtouch/script/ directory of the BlackLab source distribution, but they are reproduced here for convenience.

The first shell script activates the vmtouch daemon for a number of corpora under the same base directory. The second shell script checks the cache status for these files. The third is an init script you can place in /etc/init.d (under Debian) to (automatically) start/stop the daemon on a server.

### activateVmtouch.sh

	#!/bin/bash
	# This script will read specific large files in BlackLab indices into the
	# disk cache and lock them there. This improves performance for
	# applications needing random access on those files.
	
	if [ "$EUID" -ne 0 ]
	then
	  echo "Please run as root"
	  exit
	fi

	cd $DATASETS_DIR

	for DATASET in `ls $DATASETS_DIR`
	do
	  if [ -d $DATASET ]; then
	    echo "  $DATASET"
	    FILES_TO_CACHE="$FILES_TO_CACHE $DATASET/fi_contents%word/tokens.dat $DATASET/fi_contents%lemma/tokens.dat $DATASET/fi_contents%pos/tokens.dat $DATASET/fi_contents%punct/tokens.dat"
	  fi
	done
	
	# Start vmtouch daemon to keep files in disk cache
	$VMTOUCH_BINARY -vtld $FILES_TO_CACHE

### checkCache.sh

	#!/bin/sh
	# This script checks to see how much of the set of files to cache
	# is currently in the disk cache. Should eventually reach and stay
	# at 100%.

	    FILES_TO_CACHE="$FILES_TO_CACHE $DATASET/fi_contents%word/tokens.dat $DATASET/fi_contents%lemma/tokens.dat $DATASET/fi_contents%pos/tokens.dat $DATASET/fi_contents%punct/tokens.dat"
	  fi
	done
	
	# Check to see how much of the files has been cached
	$VMTOUCH_BINARY -v $FILES_TO_CACHE
