# Example data for DocIndexerExample.
#
# This is a toy DocIndexer that demonstrates advanced custom format support.
#
# Note that for most XML or TSV formats, you should just use a .blf.yaml
# configuration file, but if your format doesn't fit this setup, implementing
# your own DocIndexer will give the most flexibility.
#
# The example format is designed to show the building blocks of indexing,
# not to be practical. It covers some, not all, of the possibilities. See the
# code for pointers to what else is possible.
#
# There is one instruction per line. Each instruction is a uppercase word
# followed by 0 or more parameter(s), whitespace-separated.
# Anything after a hash symbol is ignored.
