Classes related to BlackLab configuration. Note that BlackLab Server
contains another number of these classes; together, they constitute the
contents of `blacklab-server.yaml`. But it's also possible to use BlackLab 
tools from the command line and have them read a `blacklab.yaml` containing
just these settings.
