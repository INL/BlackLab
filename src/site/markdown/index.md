# Blacklab

### What is BlackLab?

BlackLab is a corpus retrieval engine built on top of [Apache Lucene](http://lucene.apache.org/). It allows fast, complex searches with accurate hit highlighting on large, tagged and annotated, bodies of text. It was developed at the Institute of Dutch Lexicology (INL) to provide a fast and feature-rich search interface on our historical and contemporary text corpora.

We're also working on BlackLab Server, a web service interface to BlackLab, so you can access it from any programming language. See the beta version here: https://github.com/INL/BlackLab-server
